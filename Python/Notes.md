# Python Notes

## Python operators

- It's possible to formulate the following rules:

  - integer `operator` integer `=` integer
  - integer `operator` other-type `=` other-type

- A unary operator is an operator with only one operand, e.g., -1, or +3.
- A binary operator is an operator with two operands, e.g., 4 + 5, or 12 % 5.

## Python Variables

- A variable comes into existence as a result of assigning a value to it.
  Unlike in other languages, you don't need to declare it in any special way.
- If you assign any value to a nonexistent variable,
  the variable will be automatically created. You don't need to do anything else.
- Python is a dynamically-typed language, which means you don't need to declare
  variables in it. (2.1.4.3) To assign values to variables, you can use a simple
  assignment operator in the form of the equal (=) sign, i.e., var = 1.
