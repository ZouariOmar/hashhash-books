## NVMe

- **NVM Express (NVMe) or Non-Volatile Memory Host Controller Interface Specification (NVMHCIS)** is an open, logical-device interface specification for accessing a computer's non-volatile storage media usually attached via the PCI Express bus.
- **NVMe SSD** on the other hand use multiple PCI-e lanes that allow it to provide throughput speeds as high as 3500MB/s. That's 35x faster than hard drives and 7x faster than SATA SSDs!
- The Fastest M. 2 NVMe SSDs in 2025 Based on Real-World Performance:
  - PCI-Express 5.0 (Gen5): WD_Black SN8100.
  - PCI-Express 4.0 (Gen4): Samsung 990 PRO.
