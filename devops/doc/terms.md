- **DevSecOps**: Fosters the same culture and principles as Devops with the addition of security into the development process, ensuring security is integrated from an early stage.
- **UEFI**, which stands for _Unified Extensible Firmware Interface_, is a specification that defines the interface between an operating system and platform firmware. It's essentially the modern replacement for the older BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) and is responsible for initializing the computer's hardware and loading the operating system. UEFI offers several advantages over BIOS, including faster boot times, support for larger hard drives, and enhanced security features
