# Notes

- **What is hyperconverged infrastructure (HCI)?** Hyperconverged infrastructure (HCI) is an IT framework that combines compute, networking, and storage on a single platform. This lowers complexity and costs while enabling better scalability, flexibility, and agility in managing and deploying IT resources.

## Networking

- **Networks** are simply things connected (devices).
- **The internet**, sometimes simply called the _net_, is a worldwide system of interconnected computer networks and electronic devices that communicate with each other using an established set of protocols.
- **The World Wide Web**, often abbreviated as _WWW_ or simply the Web, is a system of interconnected public webpages that are accessed through the internet.
- a network can be one of two types:
  - A private network
  - A public network
- **IP Addresses**: an IP address (or Internet Protocol) address can be used as a way of identifying a host on a network for a period of time, where that IP address can then be associated with another device without the IP address changing.
- **MAC Addresses**: Devices on a network will all have a physical network interface, which is a microchip board found on the device's motherboard. This network interface is assigned a unique address at the factory it was built at, called a MAC (Media Access Control ) address. The MAC address is a twelve-character hexadecimal number (a base sixteen numbering system used in computing to represent numbers) split into two's and separated by a colon. These colons are considered separators.
- **Ping** is one of the most fundamental network tools available to us. Ping uses _ICMP_ (Internet Control Message Protocol) packets to determine the performance of a connection between devices, for example, if the connection exists or is reliable.
- **8.8.8.8** is the primary _IP address for Google's public DNS_. It's a commonly used public DNS server that helps users resolve domain names to IP addresses. You can configure your device's network settings to use 8.8.8.8 as your primary DNS server to utilize Google's DNS service

## What is a DHCP Server?

A DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) server's primary role is to automate the assignment of IP addresses and other network configuration parameters to devices on a network. This eliminates the need for manual configuration of each device, making network administration easier and more efficient, especially in large networks.

## What is a DNS Server?

A DNS (Domain Name System) server's primary role is to translate human-readable domain names (like google.com) into the numerical IP addresses that computers use to locate each other on the internet. It acts like a phonebook for the internet, allowing users to access websites using familiar names instead of complex IP addresses.
