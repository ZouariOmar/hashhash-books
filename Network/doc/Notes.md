# Notes

- **What is hyperconverged infrastructure (HCI)?** Hyperconverged infrastructure (HCI) is an IT framework that combines compute, networking, and storage on a single platform. This lowers complexity and costs while enabling better scalability, flexibility, and agility in managing and deploying IT resources.

## What is a DHCP Server?

A DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) server's primary role is to automate the assignment of IP addresses and other network configuration parameters to devices on a network. This eliminates the need for manual configuration of each device, making network administration easier and more efficient, especially in large networks.

## What is a DNS Server?

A DNS (Domain Name System) server's primary role is to translate human-readable domain names (like google.com) into the numerical IP addresses that computers use to locate each other on the internet. It acts like a phonebook for the internet, allowing users to access websites using familiar names instead of complex IP addresses.
