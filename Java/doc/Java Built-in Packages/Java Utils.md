# Java Utils (java collections framework)

[Java Collections Framework Hierarchy](../../res/Java Collections Framework Hierarchy.png)

**The Java Collections Framework** is a set of interfaces and classes that provide a unified architecture for representing and manipulating collections. It allows developers to work with groups of objects in an organized and efficient way, reducing development effort and increasing performance.

## Java Collections Framework Hierarchy

- Collections Framework are divided into two basic types: `Collection` and `Map`
- Represented by two interfaces: `java.util.Collection` & `java.util.Map` (Both have several implementing classes)
- import `java.util.*`; to use any of the Collections Framework types

## List interface

- List interface, sub-interface of Collection
  - Defines an ordered group of objects
  - Can contain duplicated objects
- `ArrayList` and `LinkedList` look the same because They share an interface: `List` (An example of polymorphism ("many-forms"))
