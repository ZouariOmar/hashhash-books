# Understanding GraalVM: Essential for Building Native Android Apps with GluonFX

## What is GraalVM?

GraalVM is a high-performance runtime environment developed by Oracle that supports multiple programming languages, including Java. One of its key features is the ability to compile Java applications **ahead-of-time (AOT)** into native executables using its **native-image** tool.

## Why GraalVM Matters for GluonFX Android Builds

When building JavaFX applications for Android using GluonFX, GraalVM is essential because:

- It **compiles your JavaFX app into a native Android binary (`.apk`)**.
- This native compilation means the app:
  - Starts faster
  - Uses less memory
  - Runs efficiently on Android devices without a full JVM
- It integrates with Android SDK and NDK tools during the build process.

## How GraalVM Works in Your Build Process

1. You write your JavaFX application as usual.
2. Using the GluonFX Maven plugin, your app is processed.
3. GraalVMâ€™s native-image tool compiles the Java bytecode **ahead-of-time** into a native executable.
4. The native executable is packaged into an Android `.apk` file.
5. You get a ready-to-install Android app.

## Installing GraalVM Using SDKMAN

SDKMAN! is a handy tool for managing multiple versions of SDKs on Unix-based systems (Linux, macOS). It can simplify GraalVM installation.

### Steps to Install GraalVM with SDKMAN

1. **Install SDKMAN!** (if not installed):

   ```bash
   curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash
   source "$HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh"
   ```

2. **List available GraalVM versions:**

   ```bash
   sdk list java | grep graal
   ```

3. **Install a GraalVM version compatible with GluonFX:**

   For example:

   ```bash
   sdk install java 22.3.0.r17-grl
   ```

4. **Set GraalVM as your active JDK:**

   ```bash
   sdk use java 22.3.0.r17-grl
   ```

5. **Verify installation:**

   ```bash
   java -version
   ```

   You should see GraalVM information.
