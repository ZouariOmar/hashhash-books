## What is javac?

**javac is the name of the Java programming language compiler**, which is included in the Java Development Kit (JDK) from Oracle Corporation. It reads Java source files (with the .java extension) and translates them into bytecode class files (with the .class extension), which can then be run by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

> javac is the core tool for compiling Java code. It converts human-readable Java source code into machine-executable bytecode.
