## The 6 Pillars of AWS

### Operational Excellence

- Run and fix your systems smoothly
- Real-world example: Write your setups as code. This stops human mistakes when building a server

### Security

- Protect your data and systems
- Real-world example: Lock your house doors. Use passwords and give access only to people who need it

### Reliability

- Keep your system working and fix it fast when things break
- Real-world example: Have backup plans. If one server breaks, another server takes over right away

### Performance Efficiency

- Make your system fast and use the right tools
- Real-world example: Pick a small car for short trips and a big truck for heavy loads. Use the right computer power for the job

### Cost Optimization

- Spend money wisely
- Real-world example: Only pay for what you use. Turn off servers at night if you do not need them

### Sustainability

- Think about the planet
- Real-world example: Use less energy by picking server parts that waste less power

## Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF) Perspectives and Foundational Capabilities

- **Business Perspective**: Makes sure cloud projects help your company save money and reach its goals.
- **People Perspective**: Focuses on training your staff and changing your work culture to use the cloud.
- **Governance Perspective**: Sets rules for managing costs, safety, and risks in the cloud.
- **Platform Perspective**: Helps you build a strong, modern foundation for your tech and apps.
- **Security Perspective**: Keeps your cloud data and servers safe from attacks.
- **Operations Perspective**: Focuses on keeping your apps running smoothly every day.

## AWS Cloud services

### Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)

<div align="center">
  <img src="img/aws-ec2-logo.png" width='60%' />
</div>

- Amazon EC2 (**E**lastic **C**ompute **C**loud) lets you **rent** virtual servers instead of buying physical computers
- Provides secure, resizable virtual servers (**instances**) in the AWS cloud
- You can launch virtual machines, install any software, and scale capacity up or down in minutes
- You pay only for the exact time your servers run

#### Why EC2?

- **Save Money**: You do not have to buy expensive physical hardware
- **Elasticity**: You can launch one server or thousands in minutes to handle busy days
- **Control**: You have full administrator access to the machine

#### Naming Conventions

<div align="center">
  <img src="img/ec2-instance-type-naming-conventions.png" width='60%' />
</div>

#### Instance types

<div align="center">
  <img src="img/ec2-instance-types.png" />
</div>

#### Real-World Use Cases

- Hosting Websites
- App Backends and APIs
- Continuous Testing

### Lambda

<div align="center">
  <img src="img/aws-lambda-logo.png" width='60%' />
</div>

- A **serverless** compute service
- You upload your code, and it runs automatically in response to triggers
- You do not manage any servers, and you only pay for the exact compute time your code uses

#### Real-World Use Cases

- Automated Media & File Processing
- Serverless Web & Mobile Backends (APIs)
- Real-Time Data Streaming & ETL Pipelines
- Scheduled Automation & Serverless Cron Jobs

### Storage Types (Architecture)

> How the system is set up?

| Storage Type       | Description                                                                                                             |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Object Storage** | Stores data as unorganized, flat units (objects) with custom metadata (tags) attached to each object.                   |
| **File Storage**   | Organizes data into files and folders using a hierarchical directory structure, similar to a standard desktop computer. |
| **Block Storage**  | Splits large data into fixed-size blocks. Each block has its own unique address and can be managed independently.       |
| **Cache Storage**  | Stores frequently accessed data in high-speed memory to reduce latency and improve application performance.             |

### AWS Content Delivery Network (CDN) Services

#### CloudFront

<div align="center">
  <img src="img/aws-cloud-front.png" width='60%' />
</div>

- It caches copies of your files in hundreds of global server locations.
- When a user loads your page, CloudFront sends the file from the closest location.
- This makes loading times very fast.

> Securely deliver content with low latency and high transfer speeds

### AWS VPC endpoints

- Let your private network resources (like servers) talk to other AWS services securely
- They use **private IP addresses**
- This keeps your data safely inside the Amazon network
- You do not need public internet access or NAT gateways

## AWS Routing Policy

### Simple routing policy

Use for a single resource that performs a given function for your domain, for example, a web server that serves content for the example.com website. You can use simple routing to create records in a private hosted zone.

### Failover routing policy

Use when you want to configure active-passive failover. You can use failover routing to create records in a private hosted zone.

### Geolocation routing policy

Use when you want to route traffic based on the location of your users. You can use geolocation routing to create records in a private hosted zone.

### Geoproximity routing policy

Use when you want to route traffic based on the location of your resources and, optionally, shift traffic from resources in one location to resources in another location. You can use geoproximity routing to create records in a private hosted zone.

### Latency routing policy

Use when you have resources in multiple AWS Regions and you want to route traffic to the Region that provides the best latency. You can use latency routing to create records in a private hosted zone.

### IP-based routing policy

Use when you want to route traffic based on the location of your users, and have the IP addresses that the traffic originates from.

### Multivalue answer routing policy

Use when you want Route 53 to respond to DNS queries with up to eight healthy records selected at random. You can use multivalue answer routing to create records in a private hosted zone.

### Weighted routing policy

Use to route traffic to multiple resources in proportions that you specify. You can use weighted routing to create records in a private hosted zone.
