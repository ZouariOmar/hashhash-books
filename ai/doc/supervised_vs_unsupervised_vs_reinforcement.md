# Choosing the Right Machine Learning Type: Supervised vs Unsupervised vs Reinforcement

This guide helps you determine when to use **Supervised**, **Unsupervised**, or **Reinforcement Learning**.

The decision of whether to use a supervised or unsupervised machine learning model primarily depends on 2 factors: the **nature of your data** and the **goal of your analysis**.

## 📌 1. Supervised Learning

### ✅ Use When

- You have **labeled data** (input-output pairs).
- You want to **predict an output** or **classify data**.

### 🔍 Typical Use Cases

- Email spam detection
- Image classification
- Predicting house prices
- Sentiment analysis

### 📦 Common Algorithms

- Linear/Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- SVM (Support Vector Machine)
- Neural Networks

## 📌 2. Unsupervised Learning

### ✅ Use When

- You have **unlabeled data**.
- You want to **find structure, patterns, or groupings** in the data.

### 🔍 Typical Use Cases

- Customer segmentation
- Anomaly detection
- Market basket analysis
- Dimensionality reduction

### 📦 Common Algorithms

- K-Means Clustering
- Hierarchical Clustering
- DBSCAN
- PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
- Autoencoders

## 📌 3. Reinforcement Learning (RL)

### ✅ Use When

- An **agent** learns by interacting with an **environment**.
- The model improves through **rewards and penalties**.
- Learning involves **sequences of decisions**.

### 🔍 Typical Use Cases

- Game playing (e.g., AlphaGo, Atari games)
- Robotics
- Self-driving cars (navigation, control)
- Stock trading bots

### 📦 Common Algorithms

- Q-Learning
- Deep Q Networks (DQN)
- Policy Gradient
- PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)
- A3C (Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic)

## 🔄 Decision Flowchart

```text
Do you have labeled data?
  ├── Yes → Use Supervised Learning
  └── No
       ├── Want to find patterns/groupings? → Use Unsupervised Learning
       └── Agent needs to interact with environment and learn from feedback? → Use Reinforcement Learning
```

| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Supervised Learning    | Classify traffic signs from labeled images      |
| Unsupervised Learning  | Detect anomalies in driving behavior            |
| Reinforcement Learning | Learn to navigate roads through trial and error |

| Learning Type | Input Data  | Output Goal                   | Key Feature                    |
| ------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Supervised    | Labeled     | Prediction / Classification   | Learn from known outputs       |
| Unsupervised  | Unlabeled   | Pattern / Structure Discovery | Group or reduce dimensionality |
| Reinforcement | Environment | Maximize reward               | Learn by interaction           |
