In the PIC16F84A microcontroller, external and internal interrupts are mechanisms used to temporarily pause the main program execution to handle urgent tasks. Here's the difference between the two:

### 1. **External Interrupts**:
- **Source**: Triggered by external hardware events (signals or changes on specific pins).
- **Pin Used**: Usually, the **INT (RB0/INT)** pin is used for external interrupts.
- **Trigger Types**: The external interrupt can be configured to trigger on a rising or falling edge of the signal on the INT pin.
- **Example**: If a button is pressed (connected to the RB0/INT pin), the interrupt service routine (ISR) can be executed to handle the button press, and then the main program resumes.

### 2. **Internal Interrupts**:
- **Source**: Generated by internal peripherals or modules within the PIC16F84A itself.
- **Examples**: 
  - **Timer Interrupts**: Interrupts generated by the timer module when it overflows or reaches a specific count.
  - **Port Change Interrupts**: Interrupts triggered when the state of certain input pins (RB4-RB7) changes.
- **Purpose**: These interrupts help in managing time-based tasks (like blinking an LED every second using a timer) or responding to changes in input pin states without external signals.

### Summary of Key Differences:
- **External interrupts** are triggered by events external to the microcontroller, typically through the INT pin.
- **Internal interrupts** come from the microcontroller's internal systems (e.g., timers, port changes) without the need for external signals. 

Both types of interrupts temporarily stop the main program to execute an ISR, ensuring time-sensitive tasks are handled promptly.
