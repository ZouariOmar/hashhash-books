- # Creating a New Class
	- It is generally a good practice to define your new classes in separate files. This makes maintaining and reading the code easier.
	- To do this, use the following steps in CodeBlocks:
		**Click File->New->Class...** 
	- Give your new class a name, uncheck "Has destructor" and check "Header and implementation file shall be in same folder", then click the **"Create"** button.

	- Note that **two new files** have been added to your project:

	- The new files act as templates for our new class.
		- **MyClass.h** is the **header** file.
		- **MyClass.cpp** is the **source** file.
- # Source & Header
	- The header file (.h) holds the function declarations (prototypes) and variable declarations. It currently includes a template for our new **MyClass** class, with one default constructor.
	- **MyClass.h**
		```C++
		#ifndef MYCLASS_H
		#define MYCLASS_H
		
		class MyClass
		{
		  public:
		    MyClass();
		  protected:
		  private:
		};
		
		#endif // MYCLASS_H
		```
	- The implementation of the class and its methods go into the source file (.cpp). Currently it includes just an empty constructor.
	- **MyClass.cpp**
		```C++
		#include "MyClass.h"
		
		MyClass::MyClass()
		{
		   //ctor
		}
		```
	- The **double colon** `::` in the source file (.cpp) is called the ==**scope resolution operator**==, and it's used for the function definition.
	- The scope resolution operator is used to define a particular class' member functions, which have already been declared.
