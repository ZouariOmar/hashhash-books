# Linux Tools

- **fakeroot**: Lets you build packages pretending you are root, without real root rights.
- **rpm-tools**: Tools to manipulate RPM packages (for RedHat-like systems), After install it in arch:

  ```bash
  rpm-tools installs RedHat package manager for you.
  It is useful for those who wants to create/modify RPM files.
  But do not use rpm-tools to install RedHat packages at your ArchLinux machine.
  It will break your system!
  You will need to go back to Arch wiki and read the installation guide again.
  You've been warned!
  ```

```
- **dpkg**: Debian package management system (handles .deb).
```
