A container tag in HTML consists of an opening and a closing tag. The opening tag starts with the name of the element, and the closing tag starts with a forward slash (`/`) followed by the element's name. Content is placed between the opening and closing tags. Here's an example:

```html
<div>
  <!-- This is the content of the div container -->
</div>
```

- **Opening tag:** `<div>`
- **Closing tag:** `</div>`

The same structure applies to most HTML elements, like `<p>`, `<h1>`, `<section>`, etc.
