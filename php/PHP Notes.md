# PHP Syntax
## Basic PHP Syntax
- A PHP script starts with `<?php` and ends with `?>`.
- The default file extension for PHP files is "`.php`".
- A PHP file normally contains HTML tags, and some PHP scripting code.
## PHP Case Sensitivity
- In PHP, keywords (e.g. `if`, `else`, `while`, `echo`, etc.), classes, functions, and user-defined functions are ==not case-sensitive==.
- **Note:** However; all variable names are case-sensitive!
# PHP Comments
- Syntax for comments in PHP code:
```php
	// This is a single-line comment
	# This is also a single-line comment
	/* This is a
	multi-line comment */
```
- The multi-line comment syntax can also be used to prevent execution of parts inside a code-line:
```php
	$x = 5 /* + 15 */ + 5;
	echo $x;
```
# PHP Variables
- In PHP, a variable starts with the `$` sign, followed by the name of the variable.
- **Note:** When you assign a text value to a variable, put quotes around the value.
- **Note:** Unlike other programming languages, PHP has no command for declaring a variable. It is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
- Rules for PHP variables:
	- A variable starts with the `$` sign, followed by the name of the variable
	- A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
	- A variable name cannot start with a number
	- A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
	- Variable names are case-sensitive (`$age` and `$AGE` are two different variables)
## PHP is a Loosely Typed Language
- PHP automatically associates a data type to the variable, depending on its value. Since the data types are not set in a strict sense, you can do things like adding a string to an integer without causing an error.
- In PHP 7, type declarations were added. This gives an option to specify the data type expected when declaring a function, and by enabling the strict requirement, it will throw a "Fatal Error" on a type mismatch.
